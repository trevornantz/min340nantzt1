        <h3>A little About Me.</h3>
        <p>     I am a musician in a <a href=http://www.facebook.com/thenantzlaneband/> Country Blues Band</a> and I play the bass guitar.I really enjoy country music. More specifically I like real country music, Not the kind you hear on the radio these days but good solid country gold music.</p>
        <P> I never enjoyed reading very much so I really can't say that I have a favorite book. I dont like many of them and out of the ones that I do like I dont like one enough to standout as a favorite.</P>
        <p>My favorite movie is actually a ten part mini-series called "The Band of Brothers" which is a bout the men of Easy Company from the day they started boot camp and it follows their journey through the Normandy landings at the beginning of WWII all the way up until the Germans surrendered.
        <P>Whenever I find myself feeling down or having a bad day I like to play or listen to just the right music, it could be happy music or it could be sad music. It really just depends on the kind of mood I'm in as to what makes me feel better when I'm down. </p>
        <p>I like to be outside and just enjoy the life that I have so I try to let the simple things in life make me happy. These vary from day to day but being with friends, playing music, riding my dirtbike, or just cruising down the road with the windows down listening to music are some common things that make me happy these days. </p>
        <p> I guess an interesting thing that may be interesting about me is that I have a fairly successful band that has gotten to open up and play music with some very cool people. Over the summer my band was given the oppertunity to open up for the country music superstar Joe Nichols at my hometown's city wide end of prohibition party that took place this past Fourth of July.</p>
